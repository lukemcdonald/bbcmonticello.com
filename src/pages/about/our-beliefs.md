The eternal God is one in essence, revealed in three persons—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. He has created all things both visible and invisible for His sovereign purpose that His glory might be made known.

Although much is evident about God through creation concerning His invisible attributes and divine nature, God has graciously revealed Himself in His Word, consisting of the 66 books of the Old and the New Testament. At the heart of His word is the revelation of His eternal Son who became man in order to dwell among men. He was conceived by the miracle of the Virgin birth and born without sin. He is the fullness of God, being Himself God and man. Concerning the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ dwelling among men the apostle John has written, “and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A14b&version=NASB"><small>John 1:14b NASB</small></a>).

This man who was given the name of Jesus and who was also called the Christ, was born among sinners to be the Redeemer of sinners—descendants of Adam and inheritors of his corrupted nature. The Gospel is the good news of Jesus Christ and His finished work on the cross. It is to be proclaimed to all nations for all times in order that a great multitude of sinners may be reconciled to God. To believe the Gospel is to believe in Christ. Whoever will believe in Him receives forgiveness of sins and reconciliation to God by grace alone through faith alone according to the Scriptures alone. The one who believes in Him is declared righteous in God’s sight apart from any works that he or she has done.

For those who have been redeemed, Christ during His earthly ministry has ordained the Lord’s Supper and baptism. These two ordinances are for believers and are public declarations of their connection to the New Covenant people of God.

As the New Covenant community labors (“for night is coming when no one can work”) it does so with fervent anticipation of the return of the Lord Jesus and the restoration of all things—the new heavens and the new earth. This anticipation motivates us to live in holiness in our daily life (2 Peter 3:13-14).
