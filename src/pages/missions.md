Christ has called His followers to engage in the Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20). Every Christian is called to share the gospel and to send out those who will preach the gospel and make disciples of all nations. This means that some will go to other countries, leaving the comforts of “home” in order to take the message to the farthest corners of the earth.

<h2>Onesimus Ministry</h2>

The [Onesimus Children Development Association](https://www.facebook.com/OnesimusCDA/) (OCDA) is a non-governmental organization, established in 2006 by [Nega Meaza](https://www.facebook.com/nega.meaza). In 2004, he met with visionaries to share his desire to help the street children of Ethiopia. After two years of praying what the next steps could be, Meaza and five other Ethiopians established the organization.

OCDA seeks to rescue Ethiopian’s children at risk, ensuring they remain in or return to a loving family. They provide holistic programs that meet the children’s physical, emotional, developmental, and spiritual needs.

OCDA  works with to two groups of children: Those who are on the verge of “streetism” and those who are full time street children. After starting with only seven children, Onesimus now works with 150+ children and their families. A partnership with [The Forsaken Children Ministry](https://www.theforsakenchildren.org/) allows them to have the transforming Gospel of Jesus Christ to be a central component of the program.
